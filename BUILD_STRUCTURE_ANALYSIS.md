# Build Directory Structure Analysis

## EDK2 Actual Build Structure Discovered

From CI output, the actual EDK2 build structure is:

```
Build/
└── ACPIPatcher/                          # ← Note: "ACPIPatcher", not "ACPIPatcherPkg"
    ├── DEBUG_XCODE5/
    │   └── X64/
    │       ├── ACPIPatcher.efi           # ← Primary location
    │       ├── ACPIPatcherDxe.efi        # ← Primary location
    │       └── ACPIPatcherPkg/           # ← Nested structure
    │           └── ACPIPatcher/
    │               ├── ACPIPatcher/
    │               │   ├── OUTPUT/
    │               │   │   └── ACPIPatcher.efi
    │               │   └── DEBUG/
    │               │       └── ACPIPatcher.efi
    │               └── ACPIPatcherDxe/
    │                   ├── OUTPUT/
    │                   │   └── ACPIPatcherDxe.efi
    │                   └── DEBUG/
    │                       └── ACPIPatcherDxe.efi
    └── RELEASE_XCODE5/
        └── X64/
            ├── ACPIPatcher.efi           # ← Primary location
            ├── ACPIPatcherDxe.efi        # ← Primary location
            └── ACPIPatcherPkg/           # ← Nested structure
                └── ...
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Top-Level Directory Name
- **Expected**: `Build/ACPIPatcherPkg/`
- **Actual**: `Build/ACPIPatcher/`
- **Impact**: Our hardcoded paths were wrong, but dynamic discovery works!

### 2. Multiple EFI Locations
The EDK2 build system creates EFI files in multiple locations:
- **Primary**: `Build/ACPIPatcher/DEBUG_XCODE5/X64/ACPIPatcher.efi`
- **OUTPUT**: `Build/ACPIPatcher/DEBUG_XCODE5/X64/ACPIPatcherPkg/ACPIPatcher/ACPIPatcher/OUTPUT/ACPIPatcher.efi`
- **DEBUG**: `Build/ACPIPatcher/DEBUG_XCODE5/X64/ACPIPatcherPkg/ACPIPatcher/ACPIPatcher/DEBUG/ACPIPatcher.efi`

### 3. Dynamic Discovery Success ✅
Our `find Build/ -name "*.efi"` approach correctly discovered all files, proving the dynamic artifact discovery strategy was the right solution.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Documentation Copy Paths ✅
- **Problem**: Trying to copy from `../acpipatcher/README.md` but path resolution failed
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling and path verification in ci.yml

### 2. Build Directory Assumptions ❌➡️✅
- **Problem**: Hardcoded `Build/ACPIPatcherPkg/` paths
- **Solution**: Dynamic discovery using `find` commands (already implemented)

## Workflow Status

| Workflow | Artifact Discovery | Documentation Copy | Status |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| `build-and-test.yml` | ✅ Dynamic | N/A | ✅ Working |
| `ci.yml` | ✅ Dynamic | ✅ Fixed | ✅ Should work |
| `comprehensive-test.yml` | ✅ Dynamic | N/A | ✅ Working |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Fixed ci.yml documentation copying** with proper error handling
2. 🔄 **Monitor next CI run** to verify fix works
3. 📋 **Clean up obsolete workflow files** (ci-fixed.yml, ci-old.yml)
4. 📚 **Update documentation** with actual build structure

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Future-Proof**: Dynamic discovery adapts to any EDK2 build structure changes
2. **Cross-Platform**: Works regardless of toolchain (XCODE5, GCC5, VS2022)
3. **Robust**: Multiple artifact locations are all discovered and validated
4. **Maintainable**: No more hardcoded paths to update when EDK2 changes
