# NMAKE U1065 Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Windows CI was failing with:
```
NMAKE : fatal error U1065: invalid option '/'
Stop.
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by `MAKEFLAGS=/nologo` being set as an environment variable, which NMAKE interpreted as an invalid command-line option. The `/nologo` flag was incorrectly formatted for the NMAKE environment.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed Problematic MAKEFLAGS**: Eliminated `set MAKEFLAGS=/nologo` that was causing the error
2. **Clean Environment Strategy**: Ensured all potentially problematic environment variables are cleared:
   - `MAKEFLAGS=`
   - `CFLAGS=`
   - `CXXFLAGS=`
   - `LDFLAGS=`
   - `MFLAGS=`

## Changes Made in build-and-test.yml
```batch
REM Clear all potentially problematic environment variables
set MAKEFLAGS=
set CFLAGS=
set CXXFLAGS=
set LDFLAGS=
set MFLAGS=
echo Cleared potentially problematic build flags

REM Build BaseTools with nmake (use clean environment)
nmake
```

## Key Improvements
- **BaseTools Build Order**: BaseTools are now built BEFORE calling `edksetup.bat`
- **Clean Environment**: All environment variables cleared before NMAKE execution
- **Proper Error Handling**: Build fails immediately if BaseTools can't be built
- **GenFw Verification**: Added checks to ensure GenFw.exe is available after build

## Expected Outcome
- BaseTools should build successfully without NMAKE errors
- GenFw.exe and other essential tools will be available for EFI compilation
- The build process should proceed to successful completion

## Commit Reference
- Commit: a1da396 - "Fix NMAKE U1065 error by removing problematic MAKEFLAGS"
- Date: July 9, 2025

This fix addresses the critical BaseTools build failure that was preventing successful Windows builds in the CI pipeline.
