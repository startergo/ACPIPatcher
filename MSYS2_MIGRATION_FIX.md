# MSYS2 Migration Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
The initial migration to `build-and-test.yml` had differences from the successful `test-msys2-action.yml` pattern, causing PowerShell execution errors and tool accessibility issues.

## Root Cause
- Used `msystem: MSYS` instead of `msystem: MINGW64`
- Used `update: false` instead of `update: true`
- Had different PATH detection logic than the proven test workflow
- Complex verification logic that was causing PowerShell errors

## Fix Applied

### 1. Exact MSYS2 Setup Match
```yaml
# Before (problematic)
msystem: MSYS
update: false

# After (matches successful test)
msystem: MINGW64
update: true
```

### 2. Identical PATH Detection Logic
Copied the exact working logic from `test-msys2-action.yml`:
- Prioritizes `D:\a\_temp\msys64` paths first (GitHub Actions default)
- Uses `echo` instead of `Write-Host` for PowerShell consistency
- Simplified error handling

### 3. Streamlined Tool Verification
```bash
# Now uses same verification pattern as successful test:
where clang >nul 2>&1
if %ERRORLEVEL%==0 (
  echo âœ“ Clang accessible from Windows batch
  clang --version | findstr "clang version"
) else (
  echo âœ— Clang not accessible from Windows batch
  exit /b 1
)
```

## Expected Results
Based on successful test output, the corrected workflow should now show:
- âœ… **Clang accessible from Windows batch**: `clang version 20.1.7`
- âœ… **NASM accessible from Windows batch**: `NASM version 2.16.03` 
- âœ… **Environment Variables**: `CLANG_BIN: /mingw64/bin/`, `NASM_BIN: /usr/bin/`

## Validation Status
- âœ… **Changes Applied**: Committed as b515f9b
- âœ… **Pattern Verified**: Matches working test-msys2-action.yml exactly
- ðŸ”„ **CI Testing**: Next build run will validate the fix

The migration should now work correctly with the proven MSYS2 setup pattern.
