ACPIPatcher is a comprehensive UEFI/EFI tool for ACPI table modification that works with any OS and bootloader. Originally designed for macOS systems without advanced ACPI patching capabilities, it provides professional-grade ACPI table injection and modification for development, debugging, and production use.

## Quick Start
1. **Download** or compile the ACPIPatcher binaries
2. **Create** an `ACPI` folder in the same directory as `ACPIPatcher.efi` (or place .aml files directly alongside it)
3. **Place** your `.aml` files in the `ACPI` folder (or same directory)
4. **üîç For testing/new tables:** Run from **EFI shell** to see debug messages clearly
5. **‚ö° For production:** Can run directly from **bootloader menu** for convenience
6. **Important:** Application mode patches are **temporary** (lost on reboot) - use driver mode for persistence

<summary><strong>üìã Architecture & Design Details</strong></summary>

### **Dual-Mode Operation**
- **Application Mode**: Manual execution for testing and development
- **DXE Driver Mode**: Automatic execution during boot for production deployment

### **Universal Bootloader Compatibility**
- **Primary Use Cases**: RefindPlus, rEFInd, GRUB, or custom UEFI environments
- **Advanced Bootloaders**: Compatible with OpenCore and Clover but consider their built-in ACPI systems first
- **Legacy Support**: Works with EFI 1.x firmware (MacPro5,1 and older Mac hardware)

### **Intelligent File Discovery System**
- **Multi-Filesystem Search**: Scans all available storage devices automatically
- **Priority-Based Selection**: Favors co-located files and driver-specific directories
- **Resource Fork Filtering**: Ignores macOS `._filename.aml` metadata files
- **Universal AML Support**: Loads all `.aml` files regardless of naming pattern

### **Multi-Phase AML Loading**
1. **Phase 1**: DSDT replacement (`DSDT.aml`)
2. **Phase 2**: Numeric SSDT loading (`SSDT-1.aml` through `SSDT-10.aml`)
3. **Phase 3**: Descriptive SSDT loading (`SSDT-*.aml` patterns)
4. **Phase 4**: General AML loading (any other `*.aml` files)

<summary><strong>üíª System Requirements & Compatibility</strong></summary>

### Minimum Requirements
- **Firmware**: ACPI 2.0+ compatible EFI or UEFI firmware
- **Architecture**: x64 (Intel/AMD 64-bit) or IA32 (32-bit x86)
- **Memory**: At least 2MB available EFI memory
- **Storage**: Access to EFI System Partition for file placement

### Supported Platforms
- **Intel-based systems**: Core 2 Duo and newer (including older EFI Macs)
- **AMD-based systems**: Athlon 64 and newer
- **Firmware Compatibility**: 
  - **Modern UEFI**: Most systems 2012+ with full UEFI 2.x support
  - **Legacy EFI**: Older Mac systems (2006-2012) with EFI 1.x firmware
  - **Note**: MacPro5,1 and similar older Macs use EFI 1.x, not UEFI 2.x
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux (OS-agnostic)

### Bootloader Compatibility
- ‚úÖ **RefindPlus**: Recommended - excellent compatibility with ACPIPatcher
- ‚úÖ **rEFInd**: Full support with driver directory
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **OpenCore**: Compatible but has built-in ACPI patching (see note below)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clover**: Compatible but has built-in ACPI patching (see note below)
- ‚úÖ **GRUB**: Compatible via EFI shell execution
- ‚úÖ **Direct EFI/UEFI**: Native EFI shell execution
- ‚ùå **Legacy BIOS**: Not supported (EFI/UEFI only)

**Note on OpenCore/Clover**: While ACPIPatcher can run alongside these bootloaders, they provide their own comprehensive ACPI patching systems through their configuration files. For production use with these bootloaders, their built-in ACPI features are generally preferred. ACPIPatcher is most useful with these bootloaders for development, debugging, or specific edge cases not covered by their built-in patching.

**Note on Older Mac Hardware**: Systems like MacPro5,1 (2010/2012) use EFI 1.x firmware rather than modern UEFI 2.x. ACPIPatcher is compatible with both EFI 1.x and UEFI 2.x firmware implementations.

### File System Support
- **FAT32**: Primary file system for EFI System Partition
- **FAT16**: Compatible for smaller partitions
- **NTFS/ext4**: Not supported for EFI execution (use FAT32)

**Special Notes for Older Mac Hardware**:
- **MacPro5,1 and similar**: These systems use EFI 1.x firmware and may require specific bootloader configurations
- **EFI Shell Access**: On older Macs, accessing EFI shell may require holding Option during boot and selecting "EFI Boot" options
- **Firmware Limitations**: Some older EFI implementations may have stricter memory or file size limitations

<summary><strong>üìñ How to Use</strong></summary>

### üîç **ACPI File Location Logic**

ACPIPatcher uses a sophisticated file discovery system that works consistently across both Application and DXE Driver modes:

#### **Step 1: Determine Base Directory**
- **Application Mode**: Base directory = directory where you run `ACPIPatcher.efi` from
- **DXE Driver Mode**: Base directory = directory where `ACPIPatcherDxe.efi` is located

#### **Step 2: ACPI File Discovery (with Smart Fallback)**
1. **Primary**: Try to open `ACPI/` subdirectory in the base directory
2. **Fallback**: If no `ACPI/` folder exists, scan the base directory directly
3. **Discovery**: Find all `.aml` files using the enhanced naming system

#### **Step 3: File Processing**
1. **DSDT Processing**: If `DSDT.aml` exists, replace system DSDT
2. **SSDT Processing Phase 1**: Load numeric SSDTs (`SSDT-1.aml` through `SSDT-10.aml`)
3. **SSDT Processing Phase 2**: Scan for descriptive SSDTs (`SSDT-*.aml`), skipping already-loaded numeric ones
4. **Integration**: Add all tables to XSDT with checksum validation

#### **Practical Examples**
```
# Application Mode - EFI Shell
fs0:\> dir
  ACPIPatcher.efi
  ACPI\              ‚Üê ACPIPatcher looks here FIRST
    DSDT.aml
    SSDT-CPU.aml

fs0:\> ACPIPatcher.efi
[INFO] Found ACPI directory, loading from ACPI/DSDT.aml
```

```
# DXE Driver Mode - OpenCore
EFI/OC/Drivers/ACPIPatcherDxe.efi  ‚Üê Driver location = base directory
EFI/OC/Drivers/ACPI/               ‚Üê ACPIPatcher looks here FIRST
EFI/OC/Drivers/ACPI/SSDT-CPU.aml   ‚Üê Loads this file
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ö° Application Mode (One-time patching)</strong></summary>
ACPIPatcher uses a smart file discovery system that supports two organizational approaches:

**Option 1: ACPI Subdirectory (Recommended)**
Place your .aml files in an `ACPI` folder next to `ACPIPatcher.efi`. This keeps files organized and is the preferred method.

**Option 2: Same Directory (Fallback)**
If no `ACPI` folder exists, ACPIPatcher will look for .aml files in the same directory as the executable.

The tool will automatically:
- Replace the system DSDT if `DSDT.aml` is found
- Add any other `.aml` files as SSDT tables
- Support both numeric patterns (`SSDT-1.aml`, `SSDT-2.aml`) and descriptive names (`SSDT-CPU.aml`, `SSDT-GPU.aml`)
- Avoid duplicate loading of the same tables

**üìã Execution Methods:**

**Method 1: EFI Shell Execution (Recommended for Debugging)**
```
1. Boot to EFI shell (F2/F12 during boot or UEFI shell USB)
2. Navigate to your EFI partition: fs0: (or fs1:, fs2:, etc.)
3. Run: ACPIPatcher.efi
4. Review debug output carefully - messages stay visible
5. Type 'exit' to return to bootloader menu
6. Continue normal OS boot from rEFInd/RefindPlus
```
‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- Debug messages remain visible for inspection
- Can exit shell and return to bootloader menu
- Full control over timing and execution
- Best for troubleshooting and validation

**Method 2: Direct Bootloader Execution (Convenient but Limited Debugging)**
Add ACPIPatcher.efi as a menu entry in rEFInd/RefindPlus configuration.
```
# Add to refind.conf
menuentry "ACPI Patcher" {
    loader /ACPIPatcher.efi
    options ""
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:**
- Debug messages scroll very fast and disappear quickly
- Cannot inspect output before OS boot continues
- Harder to troubleshoot issues
- Best for production use when patches are verified working

**Steps:**
1. Boot to EFI shell (usually by pressing F2/F12 during boot or using a UEFI shell USB)
2. Navigate to your EFI partition: `fs0:` (or `fs1:`, `fs2:`, etc.)
3. Place `ACPIPatcher.efi` and `ACPI` folder in the same directory
4. Run the application: `ACPIPatcher.efi`
5. Review the output for any errors or warnings
6. **Important**: ACPI patches are applied **only for the current boot session**
7. For **permanent patches**, use the **Driver Mode** instead (see below)

**Note**: Application mode patches are **temporary** - they only last until the system is powered off or reboots. The ACPI tables are patched in memory during this boot session only.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üîß Driver Mode (Persistent patching)</strong></summary>
For **permanent ACPI patches** that survive reboots, use the driver version. The DXE driver loads automatically during every boot and applies patches before the operating system starts.

**Important**: For OpenCore and Clover users, consider using their built-in ACPI patching features first, as they provide more comprehensive and tested solutions. Use ACPIPatcher with these bootloaders only for specific development needs or edge cases not covered by their native ACPI support.

**How Driver Mode Works:**
1. **DXE Driver Loading**: `ACPIPatcherDxe.efi` loads automatically during the UEFI DXE phase
2. **Smart File System Detection**: The driver intelligently searches for ACPI files across all available file systems
3. **Delayed Patching**: If storage isn't ready immediately, the driver waits for file system availability
4. **Automatic Patching**: Once the file system is ready, it automatically applies ACPI patches
5. **Persistence**: Patches are applied on **every boot** without user intervention
6. **Operating System Handoff**: The patched ACPI tables are passed to the OS

**Enhanced DXE Driver Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Filesystem Search**: Automatically searches across ALL available file systems
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Location Discovery**: Intelligently searches multiple standard ACPI paths
- ‚úÖ **Smart Directory Selection**: Chooses best ACPI directory based on file count
- ‚úÖ **Storage Timing Resilience**: Handles delayed file system initialization gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works reliably across different firmware implementations
- ‚úÖ **Driver-Relative Paths**: Finds ACPI files relative to driver location for any bootloader

**Installation Instructions:**

For **OpenCore** users:
1. Place `ACPIPatcherDxe.efi` in `EFI/OC/Drivers/`
2. Create `ACPI` folder in `EFI/OC/Drivers/` and place .aml files there
3. Add the driver to your `config.plist`:
   ```xml
   <dict>
       <key>Comment</key>
       <string>ACPI Patcher Driver</string>
       <key>Enabled</key>
       <true/>
       <key>Path</key>
       <string>ACPIPatcherDxe.efi</string>
   </dict>
   ```

For **RefindPlus/rEFInd** users (Recommended):
1. Place `ACPIPatcherDxe.efi` in `EFI/refind/drivers_x64/`
2. Create `ACPI` folder in `EFI/refind/drivers_x64/` and place .aml files there

For **Clover** users:
1. Place `ACPIPatcherDxe.efi` in `EFI/CLOVER/drivers/UEFI/`
2. Create `ACPI` folder in `EFI/CLOVER/drivers/UEFI/` and place .aml files there

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìÅ File Organization & Naming</strong></summary>
ACPIPatcher supports flexible file organization with automatic fallback:

**‚úÖ Method 1: ACPI Subdirectory (Recommended)**
```
FS0:\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ACPIPatcher.efi
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ACPI\                     ‚Üê Preferred location
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DSDT.aml              (Optional: replaces system DSDT)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-1.aml            (Numeric naming - backward compatible)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-2.aml            (Numeric naming - backward compatible)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-CPU.aml          (Descriptive naming)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-GPU.aml          (Graphics patches)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-USB.aml          (USB port configuration)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-BATTERY.aml      (Battery patches)
```

**‚úÖ Method 2: Same Directory (Automatic Fallback)**
```
FS0:\                         ‚Üê Fallback if no ACPI folder exists
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ACPIPatcher.efi
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DSDT.aml                  (Optional: replaces system DSDT)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-1.aml                (Numeric naming)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-CPU.aml              (Descriptive naming)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-GPU.aml              (Graphics patches)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SSDT-USB.aml              (USB configuration)
```

### ACPI Table Types and Naming

#### DSDT (Differentiated System Description Table)
- **Filename:** Must be named exactly `DSDT.aml`
- **Purpose:** Completely replaces the system's original DSDT
- **Use case:** Major system modifications, hardware enablement
- **Warning:** Incorrect DSDT can prevent system boot

#### SSDT (Secondary System Description Table)
ACPIPatcher supports **unlimited SSDT files** with flexible naming patterns:

**‚úÖ Numeric Pattern (Backward Compatible)**
- **Filenames:** `SSDT-1.aml`, `SSDT-2.aml`, `SSDT-3.aml`, ..., `SSDT-10.aml`
- **Legacy Support:** Maintains compatibility with existing workflows

**‚ú® Descriptive Pattern (Enhanced Feature)**
- **Filenames:** Any `SSDT-*.aml` pattern with descriptive names
- **Examples:**
  - `SSDT-CPU.aml` - CPU power management patches
  - `SSDT-GPU.aml` - Graphics device patches  
  - `SSDT-USB.aml` - USB port mapping
  - `SSDT-BATTERY.aml` - Battery status patches
  - `SSDT-ETHERNET.aml` - Network device patches
  - `SSDT-WIFI.aml` - WiFi device patches
  - `SSDT-AUDIO.aml` - Audio codec patches
  - `SSDT-THERMAL.aml` - Thermal management

**Key Benefits:**
- üîÑ **Unlimited Files**: No longer limited to 10 SSDT tables
- üìù **Self-Documenting**: Clear purpose identification from filename
- üèóÔ∏è **Professional**: Matches industry ACPI patching standards
- üîí **Backward Compatible**: Existing numeric files continue to work
- üöÄ **Smart Loading**: Avoids duplicate loading, comprehensive validation

<details>
<summary><strong>üîç Debug Output and Testing</strong></summary>

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Debug Message Visibility Depends on Execution Method**

**üì± EFI Shell Execution (Best for Development/Troubleshooting):**
```bash
# Boot to EFI shell first, then run ACPIPatcher
fs0:\> ACPIPatcher.efi
[INFO] === ACPIPatcher v1.1 Starting ===
[INFO] Found XSDT at address: 0x7FF8B000
[INFO] Scanning for SSDT-*.aml files...
[INFO] ‚úì SSDT-CPU.aml loaded and added successfully
[INFO] Status: Successfully patched 4 ACPI tables!
# Messages stay visible - you can read them carefully
fs0:\> exit
# Returns to rEFInd/RefindPlus menu - continue OS boot
```
‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- Debug messages remain visible for inspection
- Can review output thoroughly before continuing
- Can exit shell and return to bootloader
- Perfect for development and troubleshooting

**üöÄ Direct Bootloader Menu Execution (Convenient but Limited):**
- Messages scroll very fast and disappear
- No time to inspect output for errors
- Automatic transition to OS boot
- Difficult to troubleshoot issues

**üîß Recommendation for Different Use Cases:**
- **Development/New Tables:** Always use EFI Shell execution
- **Production/Verified Tables:** Can use direct bootloader execution

### Testing and Validation

**Recommended Testing Workflow:**
1. **Start with Application Mode**: Test patches temporarily first
2. **Validate Functionality**: Boot and verify patches work correctly
3. **Deploy Driver Mode**: Only after successful application mode testing
4. **Keep Backup Configuration**: Always maintain a working fallback

**Before deploying custom tables:**
1. Test with the provided `SSDT-Test.aml` first using **Application Mode**
2. Enable VERBOSE debugging to monitor the patching process
3. Verify patches work correctly **before** switching to Driver Mode
4. Keep backup of working configuration
5. Test boot multiple times to ensure stability

**Sample Debug Output:**
```
[INFO]  === ACPIPatcher v1.1 Starting ===
[INFO]  Found XSDT at address: 0x7FF8B000
[INFO]  === Starting Real ACPI Patching ===
[INFO]  Attempting to load: DSDT.aml
[INFO]  Found ACPI directory, loading from ACPI/DSDT.aml
[INFO]  ‚úì DSDT replaced successfully
[INFO]  Scanning for SSDT-*.aml files...
[INFO]  ‚úì SSDT-CPU.aml loaded and added successfully
[INFO]  ‚úì SSDT-GPU.aml loaded and added successfully
[INFO]  Status: Successfully patched 5 ACPI tables!
```

**Common issues and solutions:**
- **Boot failure**: Remove ACPIPatcherDxe.efi from drivers folder immediately
- **Application Mode works, Driver Mode doesn't**: Check file system access timing and paths
- **No effect**: Check file permissions, naming conventions, and bootloader driver loading
- **Intermittent issues**: Enable debugging and check logs across multiple boots
