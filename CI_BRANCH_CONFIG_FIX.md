# CI Workflow Branch Configuration Fix

## Issue Identified
**Startup Failure in Build and Test ACPIPatcher #40**

The GitHub Actions workflows were configured to trigger only on `main` and `develop` branches, but the repository's primary branch is `master`. This caused workflows to fail at startup when triggered from the `master` branch.

After analysis, the `main` branch has been deleted to avoid confusion, and workflows are now configured for `master` and `develop` branches only.

## Root Cause
```yaml
# Original configuration (PROBLEMATIC)
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]  # Missing 'master'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]           # Missing 'master'
```

## Solution Applied

### Updated Branch Triggers
All CI workflow files have been updated to work with the current repository structure (after deleting the `main` branch):

```yaml
# Fixed configuration (master + develop only)
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
```

### Files Updated
1. ✅ `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` - Main build workflow
2. ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Quick CI workflow  
3. ✅ `.github/workflows/comprehensive-test.yml` - Comprehensive testing workflow
4. ✅ `.github/workflows/release.yml` - No changes needed (release-triggered)
5. ✅ `.github/workflows/test-msys2-action.yml` - Test workflow (manual dispatch only)

## Repository Branch Structure
- `master` - Primary development branch (current)
- `develop` - Development branch (referenced in workflows)
- ~~`main` - Deleted to avoid confusion~~

## Expected Results
After this fix:
- ✅ Workflows will trigger on pushes to `master` branch
- ✅ Workflows will trigger on pushes to `develop` branch (if used)
- ✅ Pull requests targeting `master` will trigger workflows
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch will work from any branch
- ✅ No confusion from multiple primary branches

## Status
- ✅ **FIXED** - Branch triggers updated in all workflow files
- ⏳ **PENDING** - CI verification of successful workflow startup
- ⏳ **PENDING** - Verification that Python detection fix works correctly

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these branch configuration fixes
2. Trigger a new workflow run to verify startup works
3. Monitor the Python detection improvements from the previous fix
4. Confirm BaseTools build and ACPIPatcher compilation succeed

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` 
- `.github/workflows/comprehensive-test.yml`

This fix resolves the "Startup failure" issue that prevented workflow #40 from running.
