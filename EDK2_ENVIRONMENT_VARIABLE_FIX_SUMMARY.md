# EDK2 Environment Variable Fix - Resolution Summary

## Problem Analysis

The EDK2 warnings you encountered were caused by several issues in the workflow:

```
!!! WARNING !!! NASM_PREFIX environment variable is not set
!!! WARNING !!! CLANG_BIN environment variable is not set  
!!! WARNING !!! No CYGWIN_HOME set, gcc build may not be used !!!
```

### Root Causes

1. **Environment Variables Not Persisting**: The original workflow set environment variables locally within a batch script, but they weren't available to `edksetup.bat` because they weren't set in `GITHUB_ENV`.

2. **Dynamic Detection Failure**: The workflow attempted to dynamically detect tool paths using `where` command, but this created temporary variables that didn't persist across script sections.

3. **Timing Issue**: Environment variables were being set AFTER some EDK2 operations had already started.

4. **Duplicate Setup Steps**: There were duplicate Visual Studio environment setup steps causing potential conflicts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Pre-set Environment Variables via GITHUB_ENV

```yaml
- name: Set EDK2 Environment Variables
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    # Set EDK2 environment variables to suppress warnings
    $msys2Root = "D:\a\_temp\msys64"
    if (-not (Test-Path $msys2Root)) {
      $msys2Root = "C:\msys64"
    }
    
    echo "NASM_PREFIX=$msys2Root\usr\bin\" | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append
    echo "CLANG_BIN=$msys2Root\mingw64\bin\" | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append
    echo "CYGWIN_HOME=$msys2Root" | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append
```

**Key**: Using `GITHUB_ENV` ensures the variables persist across all subsequent workflow steps.

### 2. Environment Variable Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify EDK2 Environment Variables
  shell: cmd
  run: |
    echo NASM_PREFIX=%NASM_PREFIX%
    echo CLANG_BIN=%CLANG_BIN%
    echo CYGWIN_HOME=%CYGWIN_HOME%
    
    if exist "%NASM_PREFIX%nasm.exe" (
      echo ✓ NASM found at: %NASM_PREFIX%nasm.exe
    ) else (
      echo ✗ NASM not found at: %NASM_PREFIX%nasm.exe
    )
```

This step validates that the environment variables point to actual tools.

### 3. Simplified EDK2 Setup

**Before** (problematic):
```batch
REM Set NASM_PREFIX to point to MSYS2 NASM location
for /f "tokens=*" %%i in ('where nasm') do (
  set "NASM_PATH=%%i"
  goto :found_nasm
)
```

**After** (fixed):
```batch
REM Environment variables already set in previous step via GITHUB_ENV
echo Using pre-configured EDK2 environment variables:
echo NASM_PREFIX=%NASM_PREFIX%
echo CLANG_BIN=%CLANG_BIN%
echo CYGWIN_HOME=%CYGWIN_HOME%
```

### 4. Removed Duplicate Setup Steps

- Removed duplicate Visual Studio environment setup steps
- Streamlined the workflow to have single, clear setup sequence

## Environment Variables Set

| Variable | Purpose | Value | 
|----------|---------|-------|
| `NASM_PREFIX` | Points EDK2 to NASM assembler | `D:\a\_temp\msys64\usr\bin\` |
| `CLANG_BIN` | Points EDK2 to Clang compiler | `D:\a\_temp\msys64\mingw64\bin\` |
| `CYGWIN_HOME` | Points EDK2 to Unix-like environment | `D:\a\_temp\msys64` |

## Expected Result

After this fix, when `edksetup.bat` runs, it should:

1. ✅ **Find NASM_PREFIX** set and not show the NASM warning
2. ✅ **Find CLANG_BIN** set and not show the Clang warning  
3. ✅ **Find CYGWIN_HOME** set and not show the Cygwin warning
4. ✅ **Build BaseTools successfully** without the environment variable errors
5. ✅ **Proceed to build ACPIPatcher** without interruption

## Workflow Order (Critical)

The order of steps is now:

1. `Setup MSYS2 and Build Tools` - Install tools
2. `Add MSYS2 Tools to Windows PATH` - Make tools accessible from Windows batch
3. `Set EDK2 Environment Variables` - Set persistent environment variables
4. `Verify EDK2 Environment Variables` - Validate setup
5. `Setup EDK2 Environment and Build` - Use the pre-configured variables

This ensures EDK2 has all the information it needs before `edksetup.bat` runs.

## Testing

The next CI run should show:

- No EDK2 environment variable warnings
- Successful BaseTools build
- Clean EDK2 environment setup
- Successful ACPIPatcher build

The same pattern can now be applied to `ci.yml` and `comprehensive-test.yml` workflows.

- `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` - Added proper environment variable setup
- `EDK2_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_GUIDE.md` - Updated with key requirements and best practices
